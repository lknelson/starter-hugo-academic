I'm an assistant professor of sociology the [University of British Columbia](https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/laura-nelson/). See this [Q&A](https://sociology.ubc.ca/news/qa-with-newly-appointed-assistant-professor-dr-laura-nelson/) I did with UBC Sociology for more on my research, teaching, and what I hope to accomplish at UBC.

Previously, I was an assistant professor [at Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/), where I was core faculty at the [NULab for Text, Maps, and Networks](https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/), a faculty affiliate at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), and was on the executive committee of the [Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/wgss/).

I use computational methods to study social movements, culture, gender, institutions, and the history of feminism. I'm particularly interested in developing transparent and reproducible text analysis methods for sociology using open-source tools.

I'm on the editorial board of [Sociological Methodology](http://www.asanet.org/research-and-publications/journals/sociological-methodology) and a consulting editor at the [American Journal of Sociology](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/ajs/current).
