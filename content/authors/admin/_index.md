I'm an associate professor of sociology at the [University of British Columbia](https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/laura-nelson/) and am the director of the [Centre for Computational Social Science](https://ccss.arts.ubc.ca/). See this [Q&A](https://sociology.ubc.ca/news/qa-with-newly-appointed-assistant-professor-dr-laura-nelson/) for more on my research, teaching, and what I hope to accomplish at UBC.

Previously, I was an assistant professor [at Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/), where I was core faculty at the [NULab for Text, Maps, and Networks](https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/), a faculty affiliate at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), and was a member of the executive committee of the [Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/wgss/).

I am elected council for the Sociology of Culture and the Mathematical Sociology sections of the American Sociological Association. I'm a consulting editor and an ad hoc deputy editor at the [American Journal of Sociology](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/ajs/current) and I'm on the editorial boards of [Poetics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/poetics) and [Acta Sociologica](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/asj).
