abstract: The women’s liberation movement hotly debated both the cause of
  women’s oppression and the best approach to changing it. When treated as a
  moment within 1960s political polarization, these debates can seem esoteric
  and arbitrary. When examined across the longue durée, I show that these
  debates reflect complex and stable differences in interpretation that were
  tied to place more than to the political moment. Using computational methods
  to examine women's movements from the 1860s to the 1970s, I challenge
  long-standing theories of feminist waves and reflect on the potential for
  using computational methods, in particular when combined with qualitative
  methods and interpretation, to re-examine historical patterns in social
  movements over long time frames.
