This course aims to do three things. First, we will explore the ways data, information, and algorithms are intertwined in society, shaped by social forces but also shaping society. We will do so with a particular focus on how data, information, and algorithms impact various forms on inequality in society. Second, you will complete two assignments that will expand your own digital toolkits and will demonstrate your knowledge of data and technology. Third, your third and final assignment will ask you to propose a future use of data and technology for the social good, demonstrating how you envision yourself as a digital citizen. All three assignments are designed to showcase your skills and knowledge and, if you so choose, could be included in your portfolio as you pursue the next step of your career, whether it be in industry or academia.
