Data are everywhere: news media fill stories with supporting statistics, advertisers use our browsing history to offer products, public agencies project societyâ€™s future needs, politicians make speeches and write bills, the public votes, and we all use social media. How can we use these data to learn more about society? Exploring complex data and learning from it requires a number of skills that students develop in this class, through the lens of Boston.
