There is a lot written on encoding and decoding text, but I couldn't find anything that I found suitable for teaching these issues to non-computer science majors. This repository can be used as a lesson to teach non-computer scientists about encoding and decoding text. It contains two Jupyter notebooks, one with the exercises left blank, and one with the exercise solutions.
