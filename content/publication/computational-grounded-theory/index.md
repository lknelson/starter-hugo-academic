abstract: This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called
  computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and
  hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of
  computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive
  approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves
  inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as
  unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel
  patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an
  interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or
  further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step,
  assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and
  natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous,
  and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be
  applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches,
  interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can
  address many potential research questions.
