abstract: "Narrating history is perpetually contested, shaping and reshaping how
  nations and people understand both their pasts and the current moment.
  Measuring and evaluating the scope of histories is methodologically
  challenging. In this paper we provide a general approach and a specific method
  to measure historical recall. Operationalizing historical information as one
  or more word phrases, we use the phrase-mining RAKE algorithm on a collection
  of primary historical documents to extract first-person historical evidence,
  and then measure recall via phrases present on contemporary Wikipedia, taken
  to represent a publicly-accessible summary of existing knowledge on virtually
  any historical topic. We demonstrate this method using women's movements in
  the United States as a case study of a debated historical field. We found that
  issues important to working-class elements of the movement were less likely to
  be covered on Wikipedia compared to other subsections of the movement.
  Combining this method with a qualitative analysis of select articles, we
  identified a typology of mechanisms leading to historical omissions: paucity,
  restrictive paradigms, and categorical narrowness. Our approach, we conclude,
  can be used to both evaluate the recall of a body of history and to actively
  intervene in enlarging the scope of our histories and historical knowledge."
